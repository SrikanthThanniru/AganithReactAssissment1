I carefully read the instruction given in the documentation.
According to that i selected one application to buils
Weather One application
In this i used React framework to bulid and for styling CSS used.
In this application i added UI/UX principles, where user can feel this, while using.
Here, whenever the weather and location changes, the background weather details will changes.
In this React Hooks are used to state mangement purposes.
